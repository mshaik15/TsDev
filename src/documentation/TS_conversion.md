# ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Embedding Techniques for Vector Databases

This document outlines **four powerful techniques** for embedding time series into vectors that can be stored and queried in vector databases. These techniques are suitable for a wide range of use cases including similarity search, anomaly detection, clustering, and pattern recognition.

|  # | Method                       | Captures                     | Vector Output       | Summary                                                 |
| -: | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1 | **Sliding Window Embedding** | Local patterns, shape        | $\mathbb{R}^w$      | Slices raw values into overlapping fixed-size windows   |
|  2 | **Statistical Features**     | Global behavior, structure   | $\mathbb{R}^d$      | Extracts statistical & temporal features                |
|  3 | **Frequency Domain (FFT)**   | Periodicity, signal strength | $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$   | Transforms signal into frequency space                  |

## 1. ðŸ”¹ Sliding Window Embedding

**How it works:**

* Given a time series $x = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_T]$, define a fixed window size $w$
* Slide across the series to extract overlapping chunks:

  $$
  \mathbf{v}_i = [x_i, x_{i+1}, ..., x_{i+w-1}]
  $$
* Each window becomes a vector in $\mathbb{R}^w$

**Used for:**

* Pattern matching
* Similarity search
* Subsequence indexing

## 2. ðŸ”¹ Statistical Feature Extraction

**How it works:**

* Extract summary statistics from the full series or sliding windows
* Examples include:

  * Mean: $\mu$
  * Std Dev: $\sigma$
  * Skewness, Kurtosis
  * Min, Max
  * Autocorrelation, Entropy

**Output:** A vector in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (e.g., 10â€“100 features)

**Used for:**

* Clustering
* Classification
* Anomaly detection

**Tools:** `tsfresh`, `catch22`, `tsfel`

## 3. ðŸ”¹ Frequency Domain Features (FFT)

**How it works:**

* Apply the Fast Fourier Transform:

  $$
  X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \cdot e^{-2\pi i kn/N}
  $$
* Decompose into real and imaginary parts for the first $n$ frequencies:

  $$
  \text{FFT Vector} = [\text{Re}(X_1), ..., \text{Im}(X_n)]
  $$

**Output:** $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$

**Used for:**

* Capturing seasonality
* Detecting periodic or cyclical behavior

---

## 4. ðŸ”¹ Deep Time Series Embeddings (e.g. TS2Vec)

**How it works:**

* A neural encoder (CNN or Transformer) processes the full time series
* Embeddings are learned via contrastive learning:

  $$
  \mathcal{L} = -\log \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(h_i, h^+_i)/\tau)}{\sum_{j} \exp(\text{sim}(h_i, h^-_j)/\tau)}
  $$

  * $h_i$: anchor
  * $h^+_i$: positive (same series, augmented)
  * $h^-_j$: negatives (other series)
  * $\text{sim}$: cosine similarity

**Output:** Fixed-size vector, typically $\mathbb{R}^{128}$ or larger

**Used for:**

* Semantic similarity
* Transfer learning
* Cross-domain embeddings

**Tools:**

* [`TS2Vec`](https://github.com/zhoushengisnoob/TS2Vec)
* [`TSTCC`](https://github.com/mims-harvard/TSTCC)
* [`InceptionTime`](https://github.com/hfawaz/InceptionTime)

## ðŸ“Œ Summary Comparison

| Technique            | Good For                      | Pros                                    | Cons                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Sliding Window       | Pattern search, similarity    | Simple, fast, interpretable             | Sensitive to noise, scale        |
| Statistical Features | Clustering, anomaly detection | Easy to compute, interpretable          | May miss fine structure          |
| FFT                  | Seasonality, periodicity      | Great for trend/cycle detection         | Ignores time locality            |
| Deep Embeddings      | General-purpose embeddings    | Powerful, semantic, can generalize well | Needs training, less explainable |
